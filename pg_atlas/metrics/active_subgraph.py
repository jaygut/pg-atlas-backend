A6: Active Subgraph Projection.

Filters the full dependency graph to the ecologically active window — the
sub-population of repositories that have had observable commit activity within
the configured window. Dormant repos are excluded from metric computation but
not from the database; this is a read-only in-memory projection.

Ecological framing: like removing seasonally dormant organisms from a trophic
web analysis — they may return, but their current influence on energy flow is
negligible. Only the living, active part of the ecosystem is scored.

Ported and adapted from:
    SCF_PG-Atlas/pg_atlas/graph/active_subgraph.py
    Author: Jay Gutierrez, PhD | SCF #41 — Building the Backbone

Production adaptations:
- Input graph carries `vertex_type` (title-cased) rather than `node_type`.
- `days_since_commit` is computed by graph_builder from `latest_commit_date`.
- Returns only `nx.DiGraph` (not a tuple) — dormant set is in graph metadata.
- Sets `active=True` on every retained node for downstream criticality scoring.

    Return the induced subgraph of ecologically active nodes.

    Algorithm (O(V + E)):
        1. Classify every node as active or dormant using retention rules below.
        2. Build induced subgraph over the active node set (copy preserves edge attrs).
        3. Set ``active=True`` on every retained node.
        4. Annotate the returned graph with audit metadata.

    Retention rules by vertex_type:
        "Project":     Always retained — funding layer is not activity-filtered.
        "Contributor": Always retained — contributor risk layer stays intact.
        "ExternalRepo": Always retained — external dependencies are critical
                        infrastructure not under direct monitoring; absence of
                        commit data is expected and must not trigger dormancy.
        "Repo" with days_since_commit <= activity_window_days AND NOT archived: active.
        "Repo" with days_since_commit is None: dormant (conservative; no data =
            cannot confirm activity).
        "Repo" that is archived: dormant.
        "Repo" with days_since_commit > activity_window_days: dormant.
        Unknown vertex_type: retained conservatively with a warning.

    Graph metadata on returned graph:
        active_window_days (int): configured dormancy threshold
        nodes_retained (int): count of active nodes in returned graph
        nodes_removed (int): count of pruned dormant nodes
        dormant_nodes (list[str]): canonical_ids of pruned nodes (audit trail)

    Important:
        Sets ``active=True`` on every node in the returned subgraph.
        ``compute_criticality`` reads ``G_active.nodes[n].get("active", False)``
        to count only active transitive dependents — without this flag the
        criticality computation returns 0 for all nodes.

    Returns:
        nx.DiGraph: induced subgraph copy. Mutations do not affect the original G.
